## 1. Business Understanding

### Objective:
Analyze the impact of the first rate cut by the Federal Reserve on the S&P 500 index to understand how it affects the stock market trends, returns, and volatility.

### Key Questions:
1. How does the S&P 500 trend after the first rate cut?
2. What are the returns of the S&P 500 at various intervals after the rate cut?
3. How does the volatility of the S&P 500 change after the rate cut?

## 2. Data Understanding

### Data Sources:
- Yahoo Finance for historical stock data.
- Federal Reserve announcements for rate cut dates.

### Data Description:
- Historical daily closing prices of the S&P 500.
- Dates of the first rate cut after a period of at least one year of stable or increasing rates.

## 3. Data Preparation

### Filtering First Rate Cut Dates:
- **Criteria**: Select the first rate cut date after at least one year of stable or increasing rates by the Fed.
- **Time Frame**: From 1989 onwards, as the Fed began publicly announcing rate decisions, making the market more transparent and efficient.

### Data Collection:
- Use `yfinance` to download historical closing prices for the S&P 500 and other global stock indices.
- Example code to download data:


## 4. Modeling

### Analyzing S&P 500 Trends:
- **Time Frame**: Analyze the trend for the next 2 years (504 trading days, 252 days/year) after each first rate cut using the 20-day moving average (MA20).
- **Steps**:
  - Calculate MA20 for the S&P 500.
  - Identify trends: Uptrend, downtrend, or sideways.
  - Compare trends across different years.

### Analyzing Returns:
- **Objective**: Calculate the returns of the S&P 500 at various intervals before and after the rate cut.
- **Time Intervals**:
  - Before 3 months: -3 months to the rate cut date.
  - After 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months from the rate cut date.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Return} = \frac{\text{End Value} - \text{Start Value}}{\text{Start Value}} \times 100\%
  \]

### Analyzing Volatility:
- **Objective**: Measure the volatility of the S&P 500 before and after the rate cut.
- **Method**: Historical volatility.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \sigma_{\text{annual}} = \sigma_{\text{daily}} \times \sqrt{252}
  \]
  Where \(\sigma_{\text{daily}}\) is the standard deviation of daily returns.

## 5. Evaluation
